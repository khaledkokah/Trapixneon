# Trapixneon
Trapixneon is a small arcade game based on classics like frogger, pacman and others. The game is created using unity engine.
The game code is based on coursera MSU course, noobtuts, brackeys with game menu and level select enhancements by me.

Elements:  Full menu system with level selections template. Character controller that works with desktop, mobile and WebGL controls. Simple level creation process. Arts and music included. 

Feel free to use this project, would be cool if you can help me modify it and upgrade it.
